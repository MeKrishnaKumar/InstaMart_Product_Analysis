# Project Title: B2B Market Intelligence Pipeline (IndiaMART)
Overview
This project creates an end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline designed to extract, process, and analyze unstructured product data from India’s largest B2B marketplace (IndiaMART). It automates the collection of critical market signals—including pricing, supplier ratings, and location data—to drive competitive intelligence.

Key Technical Achievements

Hybrid Data Extraction Engine: Engineered a robust crawler using BeautifulSoup and Requests that implements intelligent caching. This system checks for local data availability before querying live servers, significantly reducing latency and preventing IP blocking (Rate Limit Compliance).

Resilient ETL Process: Built a transformation layer using Pandas to normalize messy real-world data. Key operations included regex-based price cleaning, missing value imputation, and standardization of 5+ diverse product categories (Electronics, Textiles, Industrial Machinery).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): leveraged Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover market trends. The analysis revealed correlations between product pricing and supplier ratings, alongside geographic clustering of suppliers.

Tech Stack

Collection: Python, BeautifulSoup4, Requests (Custom Headers & Delays)

Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Regex

Analysis: Seaborn, Matplotlib, OpenPyXL
